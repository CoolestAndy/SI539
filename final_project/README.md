<h2>Proposal</h2>

<p>With the advancement of technology, cell phones have become very popular, and the design of cell phones has become more diverse. When choosing a cell phone, people will consider many factors, such as price, performance and appearance, and try to compare these factors with other brands. In order to help customers decide which cell phone to buy, we decide to build a cell phone review system, which allows users to search the reviews of other customers.</p>

<p>The similar web sites is <a href="https://www.phonearena.com">https://www.phonearena.com</a>. We use 14 million cell phone reviews dataset on Kaggle to build our project. The dateset can be found on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/masaladata/14-million-cell-phone-reviews">https://www.kaggle.com/masaladata/14-million-cell-phone-reviews</a>. In this dataset, it includes 11 fields, including <code>phone_url</code>, <code>date</code>, <code>language</code>, <code>country</code>, <code>source</code>, <code>domain</code>, <code>score</code>, <code>score_max</code>, <code>extract</code>, <code>author</code> and <code>product</code>. These different elements will form diversified cell phone reviews which can help people choose the phone that works best for them from different views.</p>

<p>Related to this course, we plan to build different filters to search cell phone reviews using JavaScript.

In the home page, there are some selectors including manufacturers, carriers, languages, etc. Also there are some random cell phone reviews below filter selectors, and you can click on them to see more details. If you want to see some specific reviews, for example, you can click on "Manufacturers" filter to search different phone brands like, Apple, Google, or Huawei, etc. Then you can view a list of cell phone reviews with your prefered filter.</p>
